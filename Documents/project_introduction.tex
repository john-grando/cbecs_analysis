Building owners, local governments, and utility providers are all looking for ways to reduce energy consumption.  Reasons for doing so can vary all the way from social responsibility to economic gain.  Some  want to show off an efficient structure, others want to identify building properties that are in need of improvement.  However, this concept of evaluating performance typically requires someone to measure the buildings's consumption and then compare it to a standard practice equivalent.  Evaluating summary statistics between buildings, such as energy use per square foot, is not as simple as it seems because there are a multitude of factors that affect a building’s energy consumption profile.  Factors such as building type, number of employees, etc., can have critical importance for some buildings and not others.  This complexity of making similar comparisons creates a situation where it is difficult to determine whether a building is performing consistent with, or better than, similar standard practice buildings.

Commercially, using the most popular example, ENERGY STAR \footnote{\href{https://www.energystar.gov/}{ENERGY STAR - \url{https://www.energystar.gov/}}} has implemented a benchmarking algorithm that scores buildings on a scale from 1 – 100 using market-available data.  The output of this benchmarking algorithm is a unit-less score, as well as a reference ‘baseline’ building.  However, the methodology is not released and it is unclear what factors are important to influence the energy consumption of the building.  These barriers make it difficult to provide custom comparisons and nearly impossible to make batch predictions from a set of buildings, or variations of buildings to test what impactful improvements could be made.

Every few years, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) conducts a survey attempting to record pertinent features of these buildings, known officially as the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)\footnote{\href{https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/2012/index.php?view=microdata}{EIA Microdata}}.  While the survey is expansive (i.e. more than 600 tracked features), it is useful to identify predictors that significantly affect consumptiona and that can be attained by building operators.  This study will focus on creating a series of models to extract the most important survey questions and then use these values as predictors to train a final model that predicts fuel use consumption.
