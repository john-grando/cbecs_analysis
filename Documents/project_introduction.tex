Building owners, local governments, and utility providers are all looking for ways to reduce energy consumption.  Reasons for doing so can vary all the way from social responsibility to economic gain.  Some people want to show off an efficient building, others want to identify properties that are in need of improvement.  However, this concept of evaluating building performance typically requires someone to measure the property's consumption and then compare it to a standard practice equivalent.  However, comparing summary statistics between buildings, such as energy use per square foot, is not as simple as it seems because there are a multitude of factors that affect a building’s energy consumption profile.  Factors such as building type, number of employees, etc. can may have critical importance for some buildings and not others.  This complexity of making similar comparisons creates a situation where it is difficult to determine whether a building is performing consistent with, or better than, standard practice buildings.

Commercially, using the most popular example, ENERGY STAR \footnote{\href{https://www.energystar.gov/}{ENERGY STAR - \url{https://www.energystar.gov/}}} has implemented a benchmarking algorithm that scores buildings on a scale from 1 – 100 using market-available data.  The output of this benchmarking algorithm is a unit-less score, as well as a reference ‘baseline’ building.  However, the methodology is not released and it is unclear what factors are important to influence the energy consumption of the building.  These barriers make it difficult to provide custom comparisons and nearly impossible to make batch predictions from a set of buildings, or variations of buildings.

Every few years, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) conducts a survey attempting to record pertinent features of these buildings, known officially as the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)\footnote{\href{https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/2012/index.php?view=microdata}{EIA Microdata}}.  While the survey is expansive (i.e. more than 600 tracked features), it is essential to create a model that is usable and only requires predictors that can be attained by building operators.  Therefore, in this study a series of models will be evaluated in order to determine the most important predictors which will then be used to train a final, more complex, model.
