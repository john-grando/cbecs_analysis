Every few years, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) conducts a survey attempting to record pertinent features of these buildings, known officially as the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)\footnote{\href{https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/2012/index.php?view=microdata}{EIA Microdata}}.  While the survey is expansive (i.e. more than 600 tracked features), it is useful to identify predictors that significantly affect consumptiona and that can be attained by building operators.  This study will focus on creating a series of models to extract the most important survey questions and then use these values as predictors to train a final model that predicts fuel use consumption for standard practice buildings.
