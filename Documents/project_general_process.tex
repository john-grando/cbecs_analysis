\section{Data and Methods}
\subsection{General Process}

Due to the large number of features in the survey responses, it is not possible to analyze each one individually.  Therefore, the first steps in the process will be centered around selecting smaller subsets from various feature extraction algorithms.  The magnitude and contribution percentage of each variable will be considered in selecting features from this model.  In order to try and normalize the data, the response variable was divided by the gross floor area of the building and reported in in units of BTU per square foot (e.g. ELBTU/PerSF, NGBTU/PerSF). A neural network model will be built to take the subset of extracted features and make predictions for the selected major fuel use.  A variety of hyperparameters will be tested, using cross-validation, and compared on a common error metric.  This step will reveal the optimal hyperparameter combination to use for the model.
