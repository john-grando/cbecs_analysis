\\[0.125in]
The goal of this project is two-fold.  First, it is important to explore the data set and determine the influencing factors for each planned response variable.  Second, a predictive model will be constructed for each major fuel consumption type (Electricity, Natural Gas, Fuel Oil, and District Heat, etc.) as well as an additional model for the overall major fuel consumption, which is the sum of the fuel consumption types noted above.  Efforts will be made to explain the model inputs, but the ultimate goal is the performance of predictions.  However, the most parsimonious set of predictors will be used amongst the candidate models, in order to maximize our explanatory ability.

A summary will be provided which will try to explain the domain as well as any major indicators of energy use. Additionally an interface will be provided that can take inputs and provide predictive outputs on anticipated energy consumption.
