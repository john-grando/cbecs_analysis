{\Large {Objective}}
\\
The goal of this study is to provide accurate predictions of energy consumption while requiring as few inputs as possible.  In order to do this, it is important to explore the data set and determine the influencing factors for each planned response variable.  Once variables are selected, a predictive model can be constructed for each major fuel consumption type (Electricity, Natural Gas, Fuel Oil, and District Heat, etc.).  Additionally, an attempt will be made to predict total energy consumption using a single model.  Given the complexity of the problem, it is unlikely that the final version of any type of regression model would be easily explainable; therefore, the focus will be on the quantity and attainability of the inputs, and accuracy of predictions.

{\Large {Deliverable}}
\\
A summary will be provided which will evaluate and justify a subset of selected, high importance, variables for each fuel source.  Additionally, a set of models will be trained in order to provide predictions on major fuel consumption for a proposed building.  The result of this project will allow for users to make batch predictions for multiple buildings as well as enabling users to eplore the energy consumption profile as it varies based on changes in inputs.
