Commercial Building Energy Consumption accounts for approximately 25\%\footnote{\href{https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.php?page=us_energy_commercial}{EIA - \url{https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.php?page=us_energy_commercial}}} of the United States energy production profile.  Many economical and sociological factors are pushing owners of these buildings to reduce energy consumption and optimize performance.  However, it is difficult to say whether a building is operating efficiently or not. Using publicly available data, models can be constructed to predict major fuel consumption.  Keywords: building energy consumption, predicted energy consumption, baseline energy model.
